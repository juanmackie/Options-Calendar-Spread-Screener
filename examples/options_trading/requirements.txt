# Python dependencies for the Options Trading example

# Core OpenEvolve dependencies will be inherited from the main project.

# Add any libraries needed for financial data analysis,
# options pricing, or interacting with the chosen backtesting API.
# Examples (uncomment and specify versions as needed):
pandas
numpy
PyYAML
openai>=1.0.0
# requests
# scipy
# mplfinance
# py_vollib_vectorized

# For the evaluator, if connecting to a specific API,
# its client library might be needed here.
# e.g., ib_insync (for Interactive Brokers)
# e.g., td-ameritrade-python-api (for TD Ameritrade)
